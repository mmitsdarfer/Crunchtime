The what (my original idea):
- A program that scrapes the scores of multiple sports games and gives the link to the closest score. If multiple with same score delta, closest to the end of game or highest in standings
- It refreshes the scores every [set time period] but when you click "It's a commercial!" it refreshes and takes you to the next game

known errors:
1 preferences.json ending unexpectedly. add some wait/async?
2 clicking logo fails to fetch sometimes
   - just occasionally really slow (?)

To do:
1 If json.length == 0, make new json
2 when server crashes frontend stays up, so can I reboot it programmatically or signal it crashed?
7 Add favorite teams(?)
   - Might make sense to wait until adding multiple sports
8 Switch to for-of loops if applicable
9 See if specific errors above still exist
10 Add team logos
11 Replace "standings" with "stands" everywhere
12 (Evergreen) Document code and check for unneeded parts
      - make sure I don't need firstUnstart in mlbScrape and remove it
13 (Evergreen) Update readme
14 (Evergreen/do if any new links show up) Add streaming/other online links for non-NHL sports
- Pie in the sky/longterm:   
   - Add upcoming days
   - Combine multiple sports 
      - Would need diffs to be to scale because 3 pt football game != 3 goal hockey game
      - Or could show the 1st of each sport, then the 2nd of each, and so on
   - Don't re-scrape ended games to improve efficiency (?)
   - Host on netlify or simlar (?)
