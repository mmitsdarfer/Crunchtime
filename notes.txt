The what (my original idea):
- A program that scrapes the scores of multiple sports games and gives the link to the closest score. If multiple with same score delta, closest to the end of game or highest in standings
- It refreshes the scores every [set time period] but when you click "It's a commercial!" it refreshes and takes you to the next game

known errors:
- need to visit backend league page (8000/{league}) to create new json
- detailed links for espn+ don't seem to be working
- games ended in SO have progress ended but timeRank is treated like they're ongoing
- when cookies don't exist they can only be created on home page & /preferences, but /preferences doesn't populate dropdowns
   until refreshing
- still get:
   "if((time[2].includes('OT')))
                  ^
   TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes') "
         I think this is when period or quarter is shown without "End of" (eg "3rd" on its own)
            Use NaN and length so if it's just 3rd (for example) vs 3:01 - 3rd I can differentiate (?)
- rapidly refreshing no longer creates duplicates, but too many requests causes timeout and kills program
   - Maybe add some timeout like with getCookies() in server.js
- when some games have channel links and others don't the columns become misaligned
   - This pops up most when some games are ended
      - Just create empty object (div?) to keep spacing consistent

To do:
- Give option of how long to refresh server (?)
- Work on jsons before they exist
- Change tab icon
- Add favorite teams(?)
- Switch to for-of loops if applicable
- See if specific errors above still exist
- getCookies is kind of repeated in calls to league pages because each cookie is collected again
- Update readme
- See what happens when cookies don't yet exist
   - They can only be created in home page or with a delay in /preference
- (do if any new links show up) Add streaming/other online links for non-NHL sports
- Add team logos
- (Evergreen) Document code and get rid of unneeded parts
- Host on netlify or simlar?
- Pie in the sky/longterm:   
   - Add upcoming days
   - Combine multiple sports 
      - Would need diffs to be to scale because 3 pt football game != 3 goal hockey game
      - Or could show the 1st of each sport, then the 2nd of each, and so on
