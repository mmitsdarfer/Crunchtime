The what (my original idea):
- A program that scrapes the scores of multiple sports games and gives the link to the closest score. If multiple with same score delta, closest to the end of game or highest in standings
- It refreshes the scores every [set time period] but when you click "It's a commercial!" it refreshes and takes you to the next game

known errors:
- When takeMe is enabled but no link is available a blank tab opens
   - I think only for "[net] has no available links"
- MLB all broken
- MLB still crashes sometimes:
         file:///C:/Users/mikey/OneDrive/Desktop/CrunchTime/Crunchtime/crunchtime/src/backend/scrape-sort/mlbScrape.js:156
                  data.table.push(obj);
                                  ^
         TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'push')

- when cookies don't exist they can only be created on home page & /preferences, but /preferences doesn't populate dropdowns
   until refreshing
- rapidly refreshing no longer creates duplicates, but too many requests causes timeout and kills program
   - Maybe add some timeout like with getCookies() in server.js
- when server crashes frontend stays up, so can I reboot it programmatically or signal it crashed?

To do:
- Give option of how long to refresh server (?)
- Work on jsons before they exist
- Change tab icon
- Add favorite teams(?)
- Switch to for-of loops if applicable
- See if specific errors above still exist
- getCookies is kind of repeated in calls to league pages because each cookie is collected again
- Update readme
- See what happens when cookies don't yet exist
   - They can only be created in home page or with a delay in /preference
- (do if any new links show up) Add streaming/other online links for non-NHL sports
- Add team logos
- (Evergreen) Document code and get rid of unneeded parts
- Host on netlify or simlar?
- Pie in the sky/longterm:   
   - Add upcoming days
   - Combine multiple sports 
      - Would need diffs to be to scale because 3 pt football game != 3 goal hockey game
      - Or could show the 1st of each sport, then the 2nd of each, and so on
