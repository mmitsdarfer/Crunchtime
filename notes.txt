The what (my original idea):
- A program that scrapes the scores of multiple sports games and gives the link to the closest score. If multiple with same score delta, closest to the end of game or highest in standings
- It refreshes the scores every [set time period] but when you click "It's a commercial!" it refreshes and takes you to the next game

known errors:
1 reset getting caught on true after clicking
   reset also deletes 1 league -> only mlb & nba
      this might not just be due to reset because it happened multiple times a good while after manually making reset false
2 clicking logo fails to fetch sometimes
   - just occasionally really slow
      - every time I try to fix this it stops happening or at least isn't as slow as before 
         - this is because opening devtools changes how it loads

To do:
2 Put react js files into a folder (?)
3 Change tab name to reflect current page
4 Fetch POST instead of cookies (?)
5 Make so when standings are updated old standings are used until new ones are done scraping
6 ctrl+f todo/to do
7 is there a way to distinguish btwn espn+ and espn on cable? most people just have latter
(Evergreen) Document code and check for unneeded parts
(Evergreen) See if specific errors above still exist
(Evergreen) Update readme
(Evergreen/do if any new links show up) Add streaming/other online links
- Pie in the sky/longterm:   
   - Add upcoming days
   - Combine multiple sports 
      - Would need diffs to be to scale because 3 pt football game != 3 goal hockey game
      - Or could show the 1st of each sport, then the 2nd of each, and so on
   - Add favorite teams(?)
      - Might make sense to wait until adding multiple sports
   - Don't re-scrape ended games to improve efficiency (?)
   - Host on netlify or simlar (?) 
      -> Scott said AWS
   - Let user enter their local streams (?)
