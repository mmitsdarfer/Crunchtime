The what (my original idea):
- A program that scrapes the scores of multiple sports games and gives the link to the closest score. If multiple with same score delta, closest to the end of game or highest in standings
- It refreshes the scores every [set time period] but when you click "It's a commercial!" it refreshes and takes you to the next game

known errors:
- Sometimes preferences.json is parsed before it is done updating. I think just for mlb, so maybe add some await/async to mlbScrape
- Incorrect links are back 
- When takeMe is enabled but no link is available a blank tab opens
   - I think only for "[net] has no available links"
- MLB all broken (not showing some scores)
   - Just when not all games have same progress (?)
- when cookies don't exist they can only be created on home page & /preferences, but /preferences doesn't populate dropdowns
   until refreshing
- rapidly refreshing no longer creates duplicates, but too many requests causes timeout and kills program
   - Maybe add some timeout like with getCookies() in server.js
- when server crashes frontend stays up, so can I reboot it programmatically or signal it crashed?

To do:
- Vertically center mlb logo
- I feel like when dropdowns are actuallly down the choices don't look centered and maybe too small
- Make channels/nets/links their own js file
   - Improve efficiency by only calling if net is defined
- Give option of how long to refresh server (?)
- Work on jsons before they exist
- Change tab icon
- Add favorite teams(?)
- Switch to for-of loops if applicable
- See if specific errors above still exist
- getCookies is kind of repeated in calls to league pages because each cookie is collected again
- Update readme
- See what happens when cookies don't yet exist
   - They can only be created in home page or with a delay in /preference
- (do if any new links show up) Add streaming/other online links for non-NHL sports
- Add team logos
- (Evergreen) Document code and check for unneeded parts
      - make sure I don't need firstUnstart in mlbScrape and remove it
- Host on netlify or simlar?
- Pie in the sky/longterm:   
   - Add upcoming days
   - Combine multiple sports 
      - Would need diffs to be to scale because 3 pt football game != 3 goal hockey game
      - Or could show the 1st of each sport, then the 2nd of each, and so on

WIWWO: 
4/5: Think all mlb and sort are fixed
Next: center mlb logo & fix dropdowns
