The what (my original idea):
- A program that scrapes the scores of multiple sports games and gives the link to the closest score. If multiple with same score delta, closest to the end of game or highest in standings
- It refreshes the scores every [set time period] but when you click "It's a commercial!" it refreshes and takes you to the next game

known errors:
1 clicking logo fails to fetch sometimes
   - just occasionally really slow
      - every time I try to fix this it stops happening or at least isn't as slow as before 
         - this is because opening devtools changes how it loads

To do:
1 Add favorite teams(?)
   - Might make sense to wait until adding multiple sports
2 Replace "standings" with "stands" everywhere
3 Let user define what streaming service/channels they have
4 (Evergreen) Document code and check for unneeded parts
5 (Evergreen) See if specific errors above still exist
6 (Evergreen) Update readme
7 (Evergreen/do if any new links show up) Add streaming/other online links for non-NHL sports
- Pie in the sky/longterm:   
   - Add upcoming days
   - Combine multiple sports 
      - Would need diffs to be to scale because 3 pt football game != 3 goal hockey game
      - Or could show the 1st of each sport, then the 2nd of each, and so on
   - Don't re-scrape ended games to improve efficiency (?)
   - Host on netlify or simlar (?)
