The what (my original idea):
- A program that scrapes the scores of multiple sports games and gives the link to the closest score. If multiple with same score delta, closest to the end of game or highest in standings
- It refreshes the scores every [set time period] but when you click "It's a commercial!" it refreshes and takes you to the next game

known errors:
- Sometimes preferences.json is parsed before it is done updating
- Incorrect links are back?
- When takeMe is enabled but no link is available a blank tab opens
   - I think only for "[net] has no available links"
- when cookies don't exist they can only be created on home page & /preferences, but /preferences doesn't populate dropdowns
   until refreshing
- when server crashes frontend stays up, so can I reboot it programmatically or signal it crashed?

To do:
- It's working but I don't understand why finalSort 2nd order pushes the opposite rank
- Make channels/nets/links their own js file
   - Improve efficiency by only calling if net is defined
- Work on jsons before they exist
- Change tab icon
- Add favorite teams(?)
- Switch to for-of loops if applicable
- See if specific errors above still exist
- (Evergreen) Update readme
- See what happens when cookies don't yet exist
   - They can only be created in home page or with a delay in /preference
- (do if any new links show up) Add streaming/other online links for non-NHL sports
- Add team logos
- (Evergreen) Document code and check for unneeded parts
      - make sure I don't need firstUnstart in mlbScrape and remove it
- Host on netlify or simlar (?)
- Pie in the sky/longterm:   
   - Add upcoming days
   - Combine multiple sports 
      - Would need diffs to be to scale because 3 pt football game != 3 goal hockey game
      - Or could show the 1st of each sport, then the 2nd of each, and so on
   - Don't re-scrape ended games to improve efficiency (?)
